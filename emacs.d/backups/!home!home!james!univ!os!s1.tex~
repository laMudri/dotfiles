\item .
\item Since most computers work with just high and low values, these are used to encode binary numbers. Hence, binary numbers are used to address memory, and thus, if all of address space is to have a correspondence to memory, the size of memory will be a power of 2.
\item Processors usually contain an arithmetic logic unit, providing addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and comparisons for integers of a predefined size.
\item Two's complement allows positive and negative numbers to be summed by a standard full adder, saving on the amount of circuitry needed in the ALU. It also means that a separate subtraction circuit isn't needed.
\item Little endian means that any number made up of multiple words can be interpreted directly as a base \(w\) (where \(w\) is the word size) where word 0 gives the \(w^0\) digit, word 1 gives the \(w^1\) digit, \&c. Big endian means that, for two's complement integers, the sign of a multi-word number can be deduced from the first word.
\item A stack frame will contain an instruction number denoting the part of the program to return to, along with the values for each of its parameters.
\item In the average case, the time taken to access a datum is the time taken for the arm to reach the correct radius plus half of the time it takes for the disk to rotate.
\item \(2764800000\) bits per second (approximately \(2.6\,Gib/s\)).
\item DMA gives a way for components to access memory without the CPU being in control of the transaction. This frees up CPU time, and is useful if there are a lot of IO requests going on. Because DMA avoids the CPU, it makes attacks targeted on DMA-accessible memory easier. These attacks can be avoided by having, rather than direct access, access via an IOMMU. This limits DMA devices to specific areas of memory.
